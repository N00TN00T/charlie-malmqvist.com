						<h2>[Mid 2020 - Present] Apparatus</h2>
						<p>
							With a passion for the technology behind game engines and an ever-evolving 
							competence in low-level programming I had some new ideas to start on a fresh 
							new project. Thus, Apparatus was born. <br><br>
							
							With high ambition I came up with the following core philosophies I wanted
							in my new game engine:

							<div class="article-paragraph">
								<h3>Customize everything</h3>
								<p>Everything should be customizable to the liking of the user! Be that from the color of buttons to the colors of error messages and the size of input fields.</p>
								<h3>Modular & Extensible</h3>
								<p>Everything is divided into modules (shared libraries). The idea is that these should be completely removable. If you don't want a renderer for your game you could just unload it (and probably replace it with your own). In general, things are designed to be extensible. For example, anyone can create a new asset by registering an asset loader in the asset manager module.</p>
								<h3>Modular & Extensible</h3>
								<p>With dynamically loaded modules we can rebuild a module in runtime and then do a hot reload. This means that we can compile C++ code in runtime. No scripting whatsover - just native C++ code. When building a module there's a parser which goes through the header files for some introspection. This means that there's some simple language extension for creating components and the like in runtime.</p>
								<h3>No hidden data</h3>
								<p>There cannot be full modularity if all data is hidden. Everything in the engine is in some way accessible to everything. This does of course mean that's it's very easy to break everything, which is why proper documentation is a must. The engine WILL crash at several occasions, but it will also be designed with this in mind.</p>
								<h3>Portability</h3>
							<p>The goal is to support all platforms and the code is design to do so. However at the moment Apparatus really only builds on Windows and most Linux distributions on x64 systems.</p>
							</div>
						
							With this I went to work with all my free time and aready by the end of
							2020 I had a much more refined game engine project, with almost all code
							running in separate modules that could be recompiled at runtime. Here's a 
							showcase of some features from the state of my project as of 21-11-2020:

							<a class="link" href="https://github.com/N00TN00T/Wizzy">
								Interactive Graphics Application Framework
							</a> that I worked a bit on my free time while studying game programming at SAE Institute in Brisbane, Australia.
							</p> <p>The framework has (as of april 2020):
							<ul>
								<li>VERY basic deferred 3D geometry renderer</li>
								<li>Advanced, featureful & secure Resource Management system (that can bind resources and files, simulating an actual resource directory on the hard drive in real time)</li>
								<li>Platform-abstracted rendering api (currently only with OpenGL 4.5 implementations):</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Textures (created from files via Resource Management)</li>
									<li>Shaders (created from files via Resource Management)</li>
									<li>Render Targets (created from files via Resource Management)</li>
									<li>Fast 2D Batch Renderer</li>
									<li>Clean Wizzy API for using current graphics API without the need of any native code</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Custom serialization language</li>
								<li>Windows support & high potential for linux support (I don't have my linux machine anymore so I haven't been able to test the linux build in a while)</li>
								<li>Runtime lua scripting with Wizzy's own high level wrapper for Script Contexts</li>
								<li>A PropertyTable that can be converted to lua table in the script context and vice versa. This table is what is serialized into the custom serialization language</li>
								<li>Very effective event system</li>
								<li>Input polling</li>
								<li>Pure data-oriented ECS system which uses the event system for ecs Systems to process data</li>
							</ul></p>
							<p>
								Here's a sample game that will constantly be expanded on to showcase Wizzy's capabilities:

							<h2>[Mid 2019] GMTK Game Jam 2019 (The One Spear)</h2>
							<p>
								For this project, me and a friend participated in a annual 48 hour game jam organized by Mark Brown,
								the creater of the youtube channel "
								<a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/McBacon1337">
									Game Maker's Toolkit
								</a>" (GMTK). The theme for the jam was "Only One". Me and my friend had several ideas and ended up
								sticking with one that would be possible to create within 48 hours. We decided on a 1v1 Player vs Player
								game with only one weapon - a throwable spear. We decided to give each player one half of the arena that
								they could move within, and could pick up the spear to throw it towards the player on the other side. This
								mechanic alone ended up to work quite well and made for a fun game, but we ended up implementing two more major mechanics.
								The second mechanic we implemented was the powerup that would increase your movement speed/dash speed/throw force.
								However, we didn't make it a tradional walk-on-to-pick-up type powerup, but instead the player had to shoot a powerup
								on the opposite player's part of the arena to get it. This added an element of progression to the game and made it 
								more intense as it went on. However, we felt there had to be some more punishments/rewards for your actions so we
								added another mechanic which made the game very interesting - a moving wall. This wall separated the player areas
								and moved in favor of the player who's winning - for everytime you hit the other player, the wall moves towards him.
								Thus, the thrower is rewarded for their good aim, and the opponent is punished for not dodging in time. This also
								added more to the progression element and had very good synergy with the powerup mechanic as the players now had
								to make more choices like "Do I go for a powerup and risk giving my opponent a lead?" or "Do I try to get the wall 
								behind the powerups so I can get them for free, but risk giving my opponent a strength advantage?".
							</p>
							<p>
								This may be my proudest creation as of writing this (May 2020) and it made for a really fun game we ended
								up playing in our free time and organized tournaments with our mates. For a 48 hour game, it was incredibly
								polished and enjoyable and had very interesting mechanics that made every match unique.
							</p>

								Here's a sample gameplay video:

						<h2>[Early 2018 - Late 2018] Legacy Wizzy Prototype</h2>
						<p>This was my first attempt at actually making a game engine and was made for a research paper I wrote called "Growth Mindset and its effects on Software Development" (School assignment, not published). 
						It's architecture is poorly designed and turned into a mess to work with (which lead to my current, way better <a class="link" href="#wizzy2020">project</a>), but nevertheless I did manage to get down a pretty neat prototype where I 
						could actually load assets, animate sprites and create a game with a simple component-based entity system. Here's some old footage (not even of its final stage):
					</p>
					<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JuXhkP7QBVY" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
					<p>
						I later implemented lua scripting and entity prefabs & instantiation which made it a whole lot more interesting. Unfortunately I do not have any footage of that right now, but I'm trying to find the project so I can record some.
						This project was a big milestone for where my interests would take me and for me to start teaching myself software development & architecture.

							<h2>[Early 2017] First game made with a team</h2>
							<p>This was the annual "profile week" LBS had, where programmers were teamed up with graphic designers to spend two weeks straight developing a game
								Altough it's obvious flaws and newbie mistakes, this is probably on of the favourite games I made. I loved the slow and punishing gameplay, and am to this day really proud of the boss I programmed and designed all by myself (with just a few months of experience).</p>

							<h2>[Mid 2016] First game ever</h2>
							<p>This is the first game I ever made. It's incredibly difficult and buggy, but I'm still impressed by what 16 year old me accomplished with 0 experience and using C# without even knowing what a class or array is. This was for my first ever programming assignment.</p>
