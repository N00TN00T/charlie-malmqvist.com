					<p>Here's all the project I made during my three years in the Swedish gymnasium (Upper Secondary School) for the Game Development courses</p>

								<h2>[Early 2017] First game made with a team</h2>
								<p>This was the annual "profile week" LBS had, where programmers were teamed up with graphic designers to spend two weeks straight developing a game
									Altough it's obvious flaws and newbie mistakes, this is probably on of the favourite games I made. I loved the slow and punishing gameplay, and am to this day really proud of the boss I programmed and designed all by myself (with just a few months of experience).</p>

							<h2>[Mid 2016] First game ever</h2>
							<p>This is the first game I ever made. It's incredibly difficult and buggy, but I'm still impressed by what 16 year old me accomplished with 0 experience and using C# without even knowing what a class or array is. This was for my first ever programming assignment.</p>
